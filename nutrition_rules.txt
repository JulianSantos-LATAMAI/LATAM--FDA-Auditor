[RULE: MANDATORY_NUTRIENTS_ORDER]
The Nutrition Facts panel must list nutrients in the following vertical sequence.
NOTE: Standard visual separators (hairlines, white space, or small gaps) between nutrients are PERMITTED for readability, provided the sequence is correct.

1. Calories
2. Total Fat
3. Saturated Fat
4. Trans Fat
5. Cholesterol
6. Sodium
7. Total Carbohydrate
8. Dietary Fiber
9. Total Sugars
10. Includes Xg Added Sugars (Must be indented below Total Sugars)
11. Protein
12. Vitamin D
13. Calcium
14. Iron
15. Potassium

[RULE: FONT_SIZES]
- The title "Nutrition Facts" must be the largest type on the label (larger than 16 point).
- The numerical value for "Calories" must be at least 22 point font size.
- The headings "Serving size" and "Servings per container" must be at least 10 point bold.
- Nutrient names (e.g., "Total Fat", "Sodium") must be at least 8 point font.

"Assume the full image represents a standard printed label. Estimate font sizes based on visual proportion. If the 'Calories' number is not at least 20% of the header section height, mark as [RULE: CALORIES_SIZE_FAIL]."

[RULE: VISUAL_FORMAT]
- "Calories" must be in bold type.
- "Added Sugars" must be declared as "Includes X g Added Sugars".
- A thick bold line must separate "Calories" from the nutrient list.
- Vitamins and minerals must declare both the quantitative amount (e.g., "20 mg") and the Percent Daily Value (% DV).

[RULE: CALORIE_CALCULATION_TOLERANCE]
CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FOR AI:
When calculating calories, you MUST:
1. Calculate: (Total Fat g × 9) + (Total Carbohydrate g × 4) + (Protein g × 4)
2. Compare to declared calories
3. FDA allows rounding - use 15% OR 20 calorie tolerance (whichever is LARGER)
4. Example calculations:
   - Declared: 200, Calculated: 210 → Difference is 10 cal (5%) → PASS ✅
   - Declared: 100, Calculated: 118 → Difference is 18 cal (18%) but under 20 cal → PASS ✅
   - Declared: 200, Calculated: 240 → Difference is 40 cal (20%) → FAIL ❌
5. ONLY fail if BOTH conditions are true: >15% AND >20 calories difference
6. Always show your calculation in the output
